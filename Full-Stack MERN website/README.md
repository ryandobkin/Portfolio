# Web Dev Portfolio Project

Web Development portfolio project made for my web development final project.
This website uses a full MERN stack, with MongoDB used for the database, Express.js and Node.js for the server and backend operation, and React for the frontend.

To view this website, open in an IDE, then run npm install and npm start on the backend and frontend roots.

Capture of my website showing list of games stored on MongoDD, being requested and displayed by React, with full edit and add functionality:
